Terraform for DevOps interview

## The code

This repo contains terraform to deploy a basic VPC with a public and private subnet, as well as an EC2 and RDS instance.

This infrastructure will be used to host an internal app for product teams based in the UK. The app will help the teams to search for data about existing and upcoming products, and will have around 50 users.
